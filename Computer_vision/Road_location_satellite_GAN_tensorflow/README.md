### Generating road masks from satellite images using GAN model
 
 The notebook in this folder was an attempt to implement a GAN model to generate a road mask from an input image. The first part deals with transforming tiff images into jpg so they can be fed into the model.

 Contents: 
 Jupyter Notebook 
 Array of all train input images saved as a npy file
 Array of all train target images saved as a npy file

 The model could not be implemented on a local machine and so a google colab notebook was developed (https://colab.research.google.com/drive/11IwxbePchEFUFHhSl66IsHRGXDZgVDKO?usp=sharing) , the input images and target images were turned into arrays and saved as npy files so they could be uploaded to google drive and used in the model. The NPY files are included in this zip file.
