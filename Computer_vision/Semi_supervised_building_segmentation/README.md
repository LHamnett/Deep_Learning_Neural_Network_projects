### Semi-supervised building segmentation using psuedo-labels

Working on a project for building detection for disaster relief and organising humanitarian aid. 
The client had minimal labelled data but large quantities of unlabelled data could be obtained for areas of interest.

Developed a semi-supervised segmentation model using a combination of psuedo-labels on unlabelled data and the real labelled data.
As the model makes better predictions for the pseudo-labels, the relative importance of the psuedo-labels during the training process is increased.

Showed equivalent or better segmentation performance compared to the existing models that the company was using, even though the models had been pre-trained on much larger datasets.
